This is a so-called "monorepo" - a single repository containing all the components necessary to build and run an app:

- a front-end built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
- a back-end built with [Express.js](http://express.js.com)
- a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) database connected to the back-end with [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)

## Exercise Requirements

To complete this exercise:

1. run this app locally on your own machine (instructions for launching the app below)
1. add a new page to the app called "About Us", where you have written a few paragraphs about yourself and included a photo of yourself (this does not require any modifications to the back-end code or database).
1. share a public link to your local instance of the app below (see `ngrok` instructions below for generating a public link)

When you have completed the exercise, leave your local copy of the app running, enter the public link to it here, and push your code changes to GitHub:

```
http://replace-with-your-ngrok-public-https-link
```

## How to launch the app

### Get the code

1. Fork this repository (accepting this as a GitHub Classroom assignment does this for you)
1. Clone your fork of this repository to your local machine
1. Navigate into the project directory

### Build and launch the database

- install and run [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- create a [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) account
- run command, `docker run --name mongodb_dockerhub -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mongo:latest`

The back-end code will integrate with this database. However, it may be occasionally useful interact with the database directly from the command line:

- connect to the database server from the command line: `docker exec -ti mongodb_dockerhub mongo -u admin -p secret`
- show the available databases: `show dbs`
- select the database used by this app: `use example-mern-stack-app`
- show the documents stored in the `messages` collection: `db.messages.find()` - this will be empty at first, but will later be populated by the app.

If you have trouble running Docker on your computer, use a database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) instead. Atlas is a "cloud"" MongoDB database service with a free option. Create a database there, and make note of the connection string. In the `.env` file within the `back-end` directory, replace the given `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` value with this one.

### Build and launch the back end

1. Navigate into the `back-end` directory
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
1. Run `npm start` to launch the back-end server

### Build and launch the front end

1. Navigate into the `front-end` directory
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
1. Run `npm start` to launch the React.js server

### Visit the web app in your web browser

- install [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- navigate your web browser to http://localhost:3000

### Let others view your app

When running locally on your machine, others can't access the app. To give temporary access to others to run the app on your machine:

- install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- run the command, `ngrok http 4000`

ngrok will then spit out a temporary URL that you can share with others to give them access to the app running on your machine

## How the project was intiially set up from scratch...

While you don't need to do this in order to simply run this app, here's how the project was intially set up

- `mkdir my_project` to create project folder
- `cd my_project` to go into the folder

Initial set up of React.js front end:

- go into the main project folder and...
- `npx create-react-app front-end` - to create a boilerplate React project for the front-end
- `cd front-end` - to go into the folder that has been created
- `npm install react-router-dom` - to install useful routing functionality
- `npm install axios` - to install a useful module for making requests to servers
- added `.env` file with port setting at which to run React locally when developing
- ran `npm start` to start up the local React development server
- start building out the rest of the code in the `src` directory

Initial set up of Express.js back end:

- go into the main project folder and...
- `mkdir back-end` to create a folder that will hold the back-end code
- `cd back-end` - to go into the folder
- `npm init -y` - to initialize this folder as an npm-powered project
- `npm install -g nodemon` - to globally install a useful module for hot restarting of the server code
- `npm install express` - install the main server framework
- `npm install mongoose` - to install a useful module for dealing with MongoDB databases
- `npm install dotenv` - to install a useful module for reading environment variables from `.env` files
- `npm install cors` - to install a useful module for allowing [cross-origin requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
- create `.env` file to hold MongoDB database credentials, express server port, and other sensitive data
- create initial `server.js` and `app.js` files to set up a basic express server
- edit the `package.json` file and set the `main` property to have the value, `server.js`
- ran `nodemon index` to start the server and auto-restart with any change saved to any file.
- try out some example server routes using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- start building out the rest of the code in the `src` directory

Initial set up of MongoDB database:

- install and run [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- create a [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) account
- run command, `docker run --name mongodb_dockerhub -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mongo:latest`
- run command, `docker ps` to verify docker is running and note the port number
- access the mongo shell with `docker exec -it mongodb_dockerhub mongo -u admin -p secret`
- run command, `show dbs` within the mongo shell to see a list of databases
- type `exit` to quit the shell after you confirm it is working
